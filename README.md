# Testing State Machines

I recently read an article and listened to a few podcasts from David Khourshid (@DavidKPiano).
In this [article](https://dev.to/davidkpiano/no-disabling-a-button-is-not-app-logic-598i), he outlines how state machines can be benificial, but immediatley implements XState.

This got me wondering how arduous it would be to create a vanilla state machine in TypeScript. 

I have taken his exact example using XState and will have it side-by-side with a state machine just to see what the code looks like and how they work.
